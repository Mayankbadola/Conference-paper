This paper presents a coupled object-human behaviour
in a Digital Human Modelling (DHM) environment.
It argues that responsive co-evolution of the configurations
of objects and human is essential for realistic performance
assessment for a given task. DHM-poses respecting the conditions
of stability and effort-budget, while the objects respecting the
laws of mechanics, emerging behaviour during a quasi-static push
operation demonstrates the significance of the proposed scene
modelling scheme. The method extends the prevailing simulation
paradigm of assessment of a given pose for a task by enabling
energetic interaction between the objects and the DHM to make
it more realistic.
